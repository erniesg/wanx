It breaks down complex theorems into manageable subgoals, using the Lean 4 formal verification system that mathematicians trust. This isn't just for academic research - it has real-world applications in education, software verification, and scientific discovery. The model achieves an 88.9% pass rate on a standard benchmark, far surpassing previous efforts. And unlike most advanced AI systems, DeepSeek made this completely open-source on Hugging Face, allowing researchers worldwide to build on it. This represents a major shift in how math could be learned and researched - imagine having an AI tutor that doesn't just tell you the answer but shows you the exact proof steps and can verify your work.",
